##What is Waldo?##
Waldo is an extension for WordPress and other PHP-based applications that dynamically generates responsive CSS background image styles.

##Why Responsive Images?##
Mobile-first web development is the industry standard these days, and images are one of the leading causes of page bloat and slow loading times, especially on mobile devices and cellular networks. When compressed and appropriately sized images are served, page size and load time decrease drastically.

##Why Waldo?##
The state of handling responsive images with regards to web development is in flux, and there is no definitive solution to serving responsive full-cover background images. Waldo presents a solution to this problem, and it does so without utilizing JavaScript or (invalid) inline-styles.

##Dependencies##
The default configuration and usage guidelines for Waldo are based on WordPress 4.4+ with Advanced Custom Fields 4.4+ or Advanced Custom Fields Pro 5.3+.

###ACF Image Object###
Waldo is built to handle ACF's Image Object (which returns an associative array). If you are not using ACF, your image array should be formatted as follows:
```php
$image = array(
    'sizes' => array(
        'small'   => "*small image url*",
        'medium'  => "*medium image url*",
        'large'   => "*large image url*",
        'xlarge'  => "*xlarge image url*"
    )
);
```

###WordPress Image Sizes###

Include the following image sizes in your *functions.php*:
```php
add_image_size('small', width, height);
add_image_size('xlarge', width, height);
```
Waldo uses a set of common breakpoints to determine the best image size. These image sizes are necessary for Waldo's default configuration to function correctly.

##Custom Configuration##
Add the image sizes supported by your theme and their associated min-width media query values in the *waldo\_sizes* array found in *waldo.php*.

*This is important, as the methods in class Waldo() rely on these key/value pairs to properly fetch image references and build the image styles.*

*For more information on adding support for custom image sizes in WordPress, visit [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/).*

##How to Use Waldo##
1. Copy **waldo-master** over to your WordPress theme.
2. Include *waldo.php* somewhere in your *functions.php* file.
    ```php
    // load Waldo for dynamic responsive CSS background images

    include('waldo-master/waldo.php');
    ```
3. Enqueue *waldo.css* in your *functions.php* file. Ensure the root path of this file is the same as the root path of the theme directory. This file is dynamically generated when Waldo is called.
4. Integrate Waldo into your template files.
  1. Before each instance where Waldo is to generate background image styles, get the Advanced Custom Field image object, and store to a variable.
    ```php
    // get ACF image object

    $image = get_field('acf_image_field_name');
    ```
  2. Set variable $waldo_styles to the function *waldoStylesArray()* to build styles and save to array.
    ```php
    // set var $waldo_styles to waldoStylesArray

    $waldo_styles = $waldo->waldoStylesArray();
    ```
  3. Pass in the ACF image object, a unique name (string), the saved styles array, and a unique class name (string) for this section.
    ```php
    // pass in parameters

    $waldo_styles = $waldo->waldoStylesArray($image, 'unique-section-name', $waldo_styles, 'unique-section-class-name');
    ```
    *The unique name may be the same as the unique section class name. The name is used as an array key for storage of style information in __waldo-styles.php__, whereas the class name is used to set the style selector for the rendered CSS in __waldo.css__.*

    ---
    *Complete code example (per Waldo instance):*
    ```php
    $image = get_field('acf_image_field_name');

    $waldo_styles = $waldo->waldoStylesArray($image, 'unique-section-name', $waldo_styles, 'unique-section-class-name');
    ```
5. Preload your site cache or click through the pages that utilize the affected template(s) and refresh to view updated responsive image styles.

-----
*__Note:__ WordPress does not allow implicit global variable access within some files (__header.php__, __footer.php__, and some template/include files). In these cases, the global Waldo variables may need to be explicitly declared at the beginning of the file in question. This may be done in the following manner:*
    ```php
    global $waldo, $waldo_styles;
    ```

    or

    ```php
    $waldo = $GLOBALS['waldo']; $waldo_styles = $GLOBALS['waldo_styles'];
    ```


##What it Does##
Waldo dynamically generates styles for background images based on media queries and associated optimal image size. Waldo *only* sets the background-image property, any other styles may be included in the regular stylesheet for the site.

##But Why *'Waldo'*?##
Who's the character most well known for always being in the background?

So the question here really should be: "Where's Waldo?" Get it? :D
